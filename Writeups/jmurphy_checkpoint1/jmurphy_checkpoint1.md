So far my partner, Salem, and I have worked to create some array stucture for the wumpus model and a visualization for it. I used pyplot to visualize all of it. The function first takes the passes array and creates a new array of rectangles. Then creating a new plot and plotting all the rectangles.

For the next part of the project, we will have done a complete model. We planned on implementing various search methods (informed and uninformed) and foraging methods (bees and ants). We'll have the ant foraging method done first because it is the simpliest of the two. With ant foraging, each agent has the same job from the beginning to the end. With bee foraging the jobs change around depending on the needs of the colony. We will also focus on various informed and unimfored searches and depending on how much information we want to give the informed search. We'll also consider prioritized foraging.

For the last part of the project, we have all parts of the project complete. We will also data to process for an analysis of sorts.

The project is also hosted on github here: <https://github.com/MurphyWants/scavenging-sim>
